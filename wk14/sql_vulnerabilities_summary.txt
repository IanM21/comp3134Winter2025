1. Ben
The query returns nothing as the user with name Ben is not active due to the 0 in the active column (0 = false)

2. Ben'--
The query returns the data of the user with name Ben due to the comment (--) which comments out the rest of the query

3. Ben' or 1=1
This throws an error as the query is incorrect due to the single quote in the name column, however if we add the comment and a trailing space
it displays every user in the database.
